# Bradley Griffith

Hello! You have arrived at Bradley Griffith's personal Github repository. 
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate some of my skills. 

Currently, I am working at Great American Insurance as a Technical Analyst.
My primary repsonsibilities involve data preparation for use in catasrophe modeling, as well as assisting in developing a data mart for the purpose of holding property data for different groups across our company.

Today, I mainly work in python and SQL, but in the past I have had professional experience in SAS, as well as college coursework in R as well as Object Oriented Programming languages including C, C++, and Java.

I also attained a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a focus in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Louisville in 2016. While the school did not allow for a minor in programming at the time, I took what programming courses I was able to, while also landing one credit hour short of a minor in physics.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my technical proficiencies, in both what I currently use in my daily career, as well as my prior experience.
